# ipset
	* iptables itself does not support matching multiple separate addresses or networks in one rule.
	* ipset is an extension to iptables that allows us to create firewall rules that match entire "sets" of addresses at once.
	* Unlike normal iptables chains, which are stored and traversed linearly, IP sets are stored in indexed data structures, 
	making lookups very efficient, even when dealing with large sets.
	* ipset lets you create huge lists of ip addresses and/or ports, with tens of thousands of entires, which are stored in a 
	tiny piece of ram with extreme efficiency.
