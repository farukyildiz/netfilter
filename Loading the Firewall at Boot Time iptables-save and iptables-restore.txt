
 * Rules created with the iptables command are stored only in memory.
 * If the system is restarted before saving the iptables rule set, all rules are lost.
 * iptables-save dumps rules to stdout or to a file
 * iptables-restore loads rules from a file into memory

		* Install iptables-persistent
		
			* apt install iptables-persistent
			* iptables-persistent automatically loads rules from /etc/iptables/rules.v4
		
		* Save iptables rules

			* iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
		
		* Remove persistent iptables rules

			* Edit /etc/iptables/rules.v4


# Dumping iptables rules to file
iptables-save > firewall

# After reboot
iptables -vnL
